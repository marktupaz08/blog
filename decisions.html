                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>Way back 2016, someone introduced to me Omegle, it is a dating site where you can talk to strangers without any traces of who you are. There, I met my first girlfriend.</p>
                        <p>We had our first meet-up somewhere in Manila, we shared our stories to each other and had fun that night. After one month, she confessed that she likes me. I said I like her too so we ended up to commit ourseleves to each other.</p>
                        <p>That's the first wrong decision I made, I lied that we have mutual feelings but I did that just for the sake of having a girlfirend. I thought that having a girlfriend will make me cool.</p>
                        <p>I lived with an idea that having many girls will make you stand out compared to others.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">I made a big mistake</h2>
                        <p>Because I don't really love my girlfriend, I cheated on her, not just once but many times. I used Omegle again to look for other girls and have fun with them. I really felt that I'm ahead of others because I've been with many girls.</p>
                        <p>I would spend all of money just to impress them, to the point that I will let my girlfriend to pay all the expenses when we are going out.</p>
                        <p>Then one day, it came to my senses that I was doing something wrong, and made me realize that my parents didn't raise me that way. I'm also wasting my time and energy to something that will not make sense in the end</p>
                        <p>I want to broke up with my girlfriend but it gives me hard time because she has mental problems. She may end her life if I did those things. But I waited for the right time to do it because I don't want to lie anymore.</p>
                        <p>After a year of waiting, I finally confessed to her what is my true feelings. Finally, I am done being a douchebag, I can now restart my life and do the right things.  </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Colors</h2>
                        <p>I thought that I will never love again, I said that I will focus on improving myself and be a better person, because I thought that no one will accept me for what I did.</p>
                        <p>And then this girl came into my life, she is now girlfriend. This time, I am true to myself, I am true on what I feel. I really thought that she won't accept me, but I'm wrong. She fulfill the spaces in my life, she gave colors on my boring and doomed life.</p>
                        <p>This girl took the biggest risk of her life, loving a man that has a history of cheating, eventhough she have trust issues. She really took the risk of loving me despite the fact that I may do to her what I did in the past.</p>
                        <p>Making an intentional mistake is bad, but it is correctable. You just need to think many times before making a decision because there is no "Ctrl + Z" in real life. And before ending this blog, I just want to leave this saying: <i><strong>“When you make a mistake, there are only three things you should ever do about it: admit it, learn from it, and don’t repeat it.”</strong></i></span></p>
