            <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5">
                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>You're probably asking yourself, "What is the best decision I have made in my life?", well you're not the only one. I always ask myself what I can consider the biggest or best decision I made and now I have the answer: taking the path to be a web developer.</p>
                        <p>Before taking this biggest step of my life, I'm doubtful if I can make it since I know in myself that I'm not that into studying. Actually I really don't see myself on where I am right now.</p>
                        <p>But here I am, writing this code to finish and submit as an assignment. I'm actually enjoying what I am doing right now.</p>
                        <p>During pre-pandemic days, I don't have any goals, I'm contented that I'm working as a rank & file employee earning minimum wage. But as the pandemic comes, the company where I am working stopped its operation due to mandatory lockdown. Stucked in our house by almost a month not doing anything gives me anxiety.</p>
                        <p>Back on that day, I felt like I am left alone by my batchmates, seeing them able to do work from home set-up, able to buy their needs and wants, and it comes to my mind that I need to do something. I need to work on myself.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Realization</h2>
                        <p>From that day, I promised that I will work on myself. I need to increase my value by learning new skills and knowledge, so that I can choose a work that can give me a comfortable life.</p>
                        <p>I realized the time wasted by doing things that will not make me a better person. I should have read books instead of watching videos, taken educational online courses instead of taking new challenges in a mobile game. </p>
                        <p>But, I also realized that it's not too late. I still have time to improve and make myself valuable in the industry. We have different timelines and I have my own so what I should do is make to a plan and take an action.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Overcoming Obstacles</h2>
                        <p>Before deciding to enroll on a bootcamp, I have been through many challenges. First thing I did on my path to web development is to search for school or organization that accepts career-shifters.</p>
                        <p>The first one I found is <a href="https://www.avionschool.com/">Avion School</a>, they have a set of projects you need to submit within 2 weeks so that you can be accepted as their student. I took that challenge but I failed due to lack of time because I have a full-time work. But I gained the basic knowledge on HTML and CSS through that course.</p>
                        <p>I searched for other schools and then I saw <a href="https://www.upliftcodecamp.com/">Uplift Code Camp</a>. I took their exam and I passed, I already received the contract for signing but I didn't sign it. I doubted my self again because I thought I wouldn't be able to finish the course.</p>
                        <p>After a month of thinking, I decided to look again for a school, and there I found <a href="https://kodego.ph/">KodeGo</a>. I passed the exam and now I am one of their students. Within three weeks the attending the class, I'm always thinking of dropping out because I am having hard time on designing. I don't have a creative mind.</p>
                        <p>But we had a class yesterday, May 27, 2022. Sir Ean, our instructor, said a phrase that gives some light on me. "Themes is the king". In web development, themes is a web page that you can modify, you don't need to make your own structure.</p>
                        <p>So far, I am still struggling but I know I can make it. I just need to work hard and always think of why I chose this path. And before ending this blog, I just want to leave this saying: <i><strong>If you don't believe in yourself, no one will.</strong></i></span></p>
