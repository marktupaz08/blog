                        <p>"I will never ride a motorcycle" were the exact words I said when I saw an accident involving a motorcycle and a car. I really hated riding motorcycle because my two naked eyes saw the blood flowing from the motorcycle rider's head.</p>
                        <p>From that day, I am really sure that I will never drive a motorcycle in my entire life. I want to live a long and happy life, I don't want to die with my bones crushed by a 16-wheeler truck or a passenger bus.</p>
                        <p>Not until I worked in Makati. I am residing in Cavite and the travel time to Makati will took 2-3 hrs, standing in a bus.</p>
                        <p>The hassle brought by public transportation makes me think to use a motorcycle as means of transportation. But I said I don't want to ride a motorcycle, I never will.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Is this a dream?</h2>
                        <p>Until one day, I just realized that I am riding a motorcycle going to work. I asked myself, "Is this a dream?. By that time, I am on my one year of using a motorcycle not only by going to work but also going to places that I love.</p>
                        <p>Today, I am now using it for 4 years and counting, it makes my life more convenient. It lessens my travel time going to work by half. I can go to places I love without thinking of the traffic and what destination of the bus should I ride.</p>
                        <p>Imagine a man really hates one thing, and now he can't live without it.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Motorcycle as source income</h2>
                        <p>Before buying my motorcycle, I think of the pros and cons. Is it worth the money? Does the expenses will be lessen when I'll use motorccle as means of transporation?</p>
                        <p>Little did I know, I can use this as another source of income. A friend of mine told me that I can use my motorcycle for delivery services</p>
                        <p>I applied as a Grab delivery rider and experienced a job that I really liked. I worked as a part-time rider after office hours and if it's holiday. I even earned my one day salary by being a delivery rider for just 3 hours. I also earned extra money from some generous clients that is paying more than the required payment.</p>
                        <p>I really enjoyed having a motorcycle I will never regret the decision I made when I bought it. It not only made my life comfortable, but it also gave me a thing that I can consider a partner in life that I can't live without it. And before ending this blog, I just want to leave this saying: <i><strong>The thing you hate is the thing you love the most.</strong></i></span></p>
